##### My company, which is suffering from suffering from some performance and scaling issues, has given me the responcibility to find out the main reason behing this failure.
_____________
In order to investigate the reason i shall be following some of the important catching approaches. these are...

1. **DataBase Catching:-** Instead of hitting the database for every request, we can cache query results in a caching layer. This reduces the load on the database and improves response times. And as we know the faster the serving speed is more popular among the  poeple. <br><br> 
2. **Content Delivery Network (CDN):-** A CDN caches static content, such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, in geographically distributed servers. This reduces the load on your application server and improves the delivery speed for end users, especially for globally distributed user bases.<br><br>
1. **In-Memory Caching:-** In-memory caching stores data directly in memory, usually within the application's process or in a separate caching layer. This approach provides extremely fast access to frequently accessed data. You can use popular in-memory caching solutions like Redis or Memcached.<br><br>
2. **Partial Response Cachin:-** In some cases, we might only need to cache specific parts of a response rather than the entire response. This approach can be useful when dealing with large or complex responses. By caching only the necessary parts, we can reduce the cache size and improve cache hit rates.
   
   Apart from these methods, there many more methods too to investigate the problem.
   But in my point of view I feel these are the most crutial steps I must take to deal with the problem.
   I shall be impllimenting these each steps one after another and then try to find out which works better for me to solve the issue.
