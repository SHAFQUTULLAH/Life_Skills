## WHAT IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT?
Any form of discrimination that includes unwelcome attention of sexual nature is considered sexual harassment. It involves a range of behaviours from seemingly mild transgressions and annoyances, to actual sexual abuse or sexual assault. Anyone from either gender can be a victim of sexual harassment, and anybody from either gender can be a perpetrator.
Sexual harassment also includes the conduct of co-workers who engage in verbal or physically harassing behaviour which has the potential to humiliate or embarrass an employee or the company.
